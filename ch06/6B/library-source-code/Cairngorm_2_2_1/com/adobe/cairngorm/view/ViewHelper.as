   /**
    * <p><strong>Deprecated as of Cairngorm 2.1.</strong></p>
    * 
    * Used to isolate command classes from the implementation details of a view.
    * 
    * <p>Model-View-Controller (MVC) best practices specify that command classes 
    * should interact with the view using the model (see the ModelLocator class), 
    * but, in some instances, command classes may require to both interrogate and 
    * update the view directly.  Prior to performing any business logic, the command 
    * class may require to fetch values that have been set on the view; following 
    * completion of any business logic, the final task may be for a 
    * command class to update the View (user interface) with any results returned, 
    * or perhaps to switch the View entirely (to a different screen).</p>
    *
    * <p>
    * By encapsulating all the logic necessary for interrogating and
    * updating a particular View into a single helper class, we remove
    * the need for the command classes to have any knowledge about the
    * implementation of the View.  The ViewHelper class decouples our
    * presentation from the control of the application.
    * </p>
    *
    * <p>
    * A ViewHelper belongs to a particular View in the application; when
    * a ViewHelper is created, its id is used to register
    * against a particular View component (such as a particular
    * tab in a TabNavigator, or a particular screen in a ViewStack).  The
    * developer then uses the ViewLocator to locate the particular
    * ViewHelper for interrogation or update of a particular View.
    * </p>
