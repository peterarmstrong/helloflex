# Ruboss code generation configuration options

# By default flex models, commands, controllers and components are genearated into
# app/flex/<your rails project name> folder. If you'd like to customize the target folder 
# (to say append a "com" package before your rails project name) uncomment the line below
# base-package must follow the usual flex package notation (a string separated by ".")

#base-package: com.pomodo

# Main ruboss controller is typically named after your rails project name (camel-cased with a word
# Controller appended at the end, e.g. if your application is called "pomodo" the flex application
# controller will be called "PomodoController"). This controller is created in 
# <base-package>.controllers folder. You can customize the name by uncommenting the following line 
# and changing the controller name.

#controller-name: PomodoController
